    Given a spatial proteomics image `raw`, a corresponding segmentation `mask`,
    and a list of markers (`channel_names`) corresponding to the channels of `raw`,
    predict the cell type associated with each index in `mask`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    raw : A spatial proteomic image as an `numpy.ndarray` with shape ``(C, H, W)``.
        A 2D multiplexed image in channel-first format. The image will be converted
        internally to ``dtype=np.float32``.
    mask : 2D label image
        Segmentation mask of `raw` as a 2D label image with shape ``(H, W)``.
    channel_names : list of str
        A list of channel markers. Must have the same length as the number of channels
        in `raw` and be given in the same order as the channels in `raw`.
    mpp : float
        The image resolution in microns-per-pixel. Improves prediction performance by
        removing scale variability.
    model_name : str
        Which pre-trained model to use. Accepts a registry version string
        (see :func:`list_model_versions`, e.g. ``"2026-06-15"``) or the
        sentinel ``"latest"``, either of which is downloaded and cached
        automatically. A bare name is searched for at
        ``Path.home() / ".deepcell/models"``, and a filesystem path to a
        ``.pt`` file is also accepted.
    device : `torch.device` or `str`
        Which device to run inference on, e.g. ``"cpu"``, ``"cuda"``, or
        ``"cuda:0"`` to select a specific GPU. All arguments after `mpp` are
        keyword-only.
    batch_size : int, default=256
        Batch size to be used for inference. Larger `batch_size` will increase
        performance by increasing VRAM usage. Default value of 256 is conservative
        and should be appropriate for systems with <16GB VRAM.
    num_workers : int, default=0
        Number of DataLoader worker processes. Default ``0`` runs the patch
        generator in-process (safe on all machines). ``PatchDataset`` is an
        ``IterableDataset`` that holds the full FOV in memory, so each worker
        is an extra copy AND re-runs the per-FOV preprocessing — only raise
        this on machines with abundant RAM and CPU.
    zarr_path : str or pathlib.Path, optional, default=None
        Optional path to a TissueNet zarr archive to read the marker / cell-type
        registry from (or set ``DEEPCELL_TYPES_ZARR_PATH``). When omitted, the
        registry is read from the vocabulary snapshot shipped with the package,
        so inference does not require the archive.
    return_probabilities : bool, default=False
        If False (default, back-compat), returns a list of cell-type names.
        If True, returns a :class:`PredictionResult` with the full per-cell
        softmax probability matrix and the cell indices.
    ct_abstention_k : float or None, default=None
        IQR-fence post-hoc abstention multiplier. Abstention is **opt-in**:
        the default ``None`` returns the raw argmax cell-type label for every
        cell and never relabels to ``"Unknown"``. When set to a float, the
        fence is ``Q1 - k*IQR`` on the per-FOV cell-wise max-softmax
        distribution and cells below it are relabelled to ``"Unknown"``
        (``k=0.2`` is a historical opt-in ablation; the paper headline is
        full-coverage with no abstention). Pass ``return_probabilities=True``
        to recover the pre-abstention labels and the ``abstained`` mask. Has
        no effect on FOVs with fewer than 4 cells
        (the IQR is undefined).
    preprocess : callable, optional, default=None
        Custom per-FOV preprocessing hook. Called as
        ``preprocess(raw, channel_names) -> raw`` where ``raw`` is a
        ``(C, H, W)`` float32 array already resampled to the model's target
        MPP and restricted to in-vocabulary channels, and ``channel_names``
        are the resolved standard marker names aligned to ``raw``. Must return
        a ``(C, H, W)`` array in ``[0, 1]``. When ``None`` (default), the
        built-in per-channel p99.9 clip + min-max normalization is used. Build
        one declaratively with :func:`deepcell_types.make_preprocessor`.
        Note: :func:`deepcell_types.preprocess_fov` is NOT a valid hook — it has
        a different signature (takes ``mask`` / keyword-only ``native_mpp``) and
        returns a :class:`PreprocessedFov`, not a bare ``(C, H, W)`` array.

    Returns
    -------
    list of str
        (default) Predicted cell-type name for each unique cell index in
        ``mask``, ordered by ascending cell index. Cells flagged by the
        IQR-fence abstention carry the sentinel ``"Unknown"`` — but only
        when ``ct_abstention_k`` is set; with the default ``None`` every
        cell carries its raw argmax label.
    PredictionResult
        (when ``return_probabilities=True``) Full per-cell probabilities,
        cell indices, predicted names, and an ``abstained`` boolean
        mask. See :class:`PredictionResult`.
