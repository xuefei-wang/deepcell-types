# Importing deepcell_types must not pull in torch (a ~1.4s import). None of the
# modules below import torch at module scope — in particular .predict defers its
# torch / model / dataset imports into the functions that need them — so
# `import deepcell_types` stays torch-free until predict() is actually called.
