"""Utilities for model / data access.

The registries below pin checksums of the paper-release checkpoints;
uploads to ``users.deepcell.org`` use the asset paths constructed below
(``models/<filename>``). The hash algorithm is auto-detected from the
digest length (32 hex → md5, 64 hex → sha256), so entries can be migrated
to the stronger sha256 individually; new entries should pin sha256. Some
baselines ship more than one file (e.g. ``maps`` needs its ``_stats.npz``
companion; ``xgboost`` needs its ``.remap.json`` label-remap), so each
baseline entry is a list of ``(filename, hash)`` tuples.
