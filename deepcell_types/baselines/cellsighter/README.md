# CellSighter baseline

Re-implementation of CellSighter (a CNN that classifies cell types directly from
multi-channel image patches) against the DeepCell Types data loader, marker
vocabulary, and cell-type labels.

Run with:

```bash
pip install -e ".[baseline-cellsighter]"
python -m deepcell_types.baselines cellsighter ...
```

## Shared interface (identical to DeepCell Types)

- Consumes the same train/validation/test split and is scored with the same
  hierarchical accuracy and macro/weighted metrics as the other baselines.
- For zero-shot evaluation, panels are aligned to the global marker vocabulary
  by scattering each dataset's channels to their global `marker2idx` positions;
  absent markers are zero-padded (`model.py:94-111`).

## Deviations / adaptations (recorded for reproducibility)

- **Backbone: torchvision ResNet-50** (`model.py:46-48`), default
  `model_size="resnet50"`.
- **Faithful 60×60 crop + ImageNet stem by default.** The default `--crop_size
  60` uses the standard ImageNet ResNet stem (7×7 stride-2 conv + max-pool),
  matching the paper-scale crop. `--cifar_stem` is an ablation that restores the
  small-patch 3×3 stride-1 stem for 32×32-style runs.
- **Input channels = `NUM_MARKERS + 2`** — the globally aligned marker channels
  plus the cell mask and neighbor mask.
- **Trained from random initialization** (`pretrained=False`, `weights=None`,
  `model.py:36-47`), matching upstream (no ImageNet weights).
- **50 epochs, Adam, constant learning rate `1e-3`, no scheduler.** The upstream
  repo constructs an `ExponentialLR` scheduler but never calls
  `scheduler.step()`, so it trains at constant LR; we reproduce that exactly and
  do not step a scheduler (`run.py:389-393`).
- **Best epoch selected on validation macro-accuracy** (`run.py:399`,
  `run.py:460-461`); validation runs every `val_every_n_epochs` (default 10) plus
  the final epoch, matching the upstream cadence.
- **Class balancing — faithful equal-proportion (default).** `--class_balance
  equal` (default) reproduces the upstream training recipe: the train pool is
  first capped to `--size_data` cells/class (default 1000, matching the paper's
  `size_data` / `subsample_const_size`), then a `WeightedRandomSampler` draws
  with full-inverse-frequency weights `weight = total / count`
  (`samplers.py:compute_sample_weights_equal`, matching upstream `define_sampler`
  with `sample_batch: true`). Two ablation schemes are selectable: `--class_balance
  sqrt` (the DCT-wide sqrt-inverse-frequency sampler with a 1000-count floor) and
  `--class_balance none` (uniform; also reachable via the deprecated
  `--no_weighted_sampler`). Remaining deviation: upstream's `hierarchy_match`
  balances at the lineage level, whereas balancing here is computed on the
  fine-grained standardized cell-type label.
