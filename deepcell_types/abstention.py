"""IQR-fence post-hoc abstention (inference-side public utilities).

This module's **import-time dependencies are numpy-only** so that
``deepcell_types.predict`` can import it without pulling in any
``[train]``-extra dependency (pandas, scikit-learn, etc.). The batched
``apply_abstention`` below imports pandas lazily, inside the function,
preserving that contract.

Algorithm:

1. For each unique group key, look at the max-softmax distribution of cells
   in that group.
2. If fewer than 4 cells are in the group, the IQR is undefined — keep all
   of them.
3. Otherwise compute Q1, Q3, IQR = Q3 - Q1, fence = Q1 - k * IQR.
4. Cells with ``max_softmax < fence`` are abstained.

Operating points:

* ``k = 0.2`` (a historical opt-in ablation, NOT a paper-headline number):
  an earlier-draft operating point that widened macro_F1 separation over the
  strongest baseline on kept cells. IQR-fence abstention was dropped from the
  paper, whose headline is full-coverage with no abstention; ``predict()``'s
  default is ``None`` (abstention off).
* ``k = 1.5`` (canonical Tukey): near-no-op (~0.23% abstained,
  +0.02pp macro).
* ``k <= 0``: callers skip abstention. (Passing ``k = 0`` to
  :func:`compute_iqr_fence` directly gives ``fence = Q1``, not a no-op.)

:func:`apply_abstention` (this module) applies the same fence to a pandas
DataFrame of DCT predictions, grouped by FOV — the batched form used by the
DCT eval CLI (``scripts/predict.py``). Abstention is DCT-owned: it is never
applied to baseline predictions.

    """Apply DeepCellTypes' IQR-fence abstention to a frame of DCT predictions.

    This is the batched form of the per-FOV abstention that
    :func:`deepcell_types.predict` applies at inference time: it computes the
    Tukey lower fence ``Q1 - k * IQR`` per ``group_cols`` group on the
    max-softmax column and relabels below-fence cells to ``sentinel``. The
    default ``group_cols=("dataset_name", "fov_name")`` is the canonical
    per-FOV bucketing used for all reported results.

    OWNERSHIP: abstention is a DeepCellTypes capability. This function must
    only ever be applied to **DCT model predictions** — never to baseline
    predictions. Baselines are scored at full coverage.

    Adds two columns to ``df``:
      - ``abstained`` (bool): True iff max_softmax < fence within the cell's group.
      - ``predicted_ct_raw``: a copy of the original ``predicted_ct`` column.
    Mutates ``predicted_ct`` so that abstained cells take the ``sentinel`` value
    (default ``"Unknown"``, matching ``deepcell_types.predict``). Downstream
    metric code that ignores the sentinel cleanly drops abstained cells from
    the macro/weighted denominator.

    Per-group fences are computed independently. Groups with fewer than 4 cells
    have no fence (no abstention fires for them — see :func:`compute_iqr_fence`).
    Groups whose max_softmax distribution is degenerate (all identical) yield
    fence == Q1, so ``vals >= fence`` is all True (no abstention fires).
