deepcell-types documentation
============================

DeepCell Types is a novel approach to cell phenotyping for spatial proteomics
that addresses the challenge of generalization across diverse datasets with
varying marker panels.

For details on running the cell-type inference workflow, see the {doc}`site/tutorial`.

The source code can be found at the [github repo][github].

For access to pre-trained models and datasets, see {doc}`site/API-key`.

## Installation

The development version of `deepcell-types` can be installed with `pip`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-types@master
```

## Pre-trained models

A pre-trained model is required to run the cell-type inference pipeline.
Pre-trained models are available via the [users.deepcell.org][dc_org] portal
according to the [license terms][license].
See {doc}`site/API-key` for details.

The latest version can be downloaded like so:

```python
from deepcell_types.utils import download_model

download_model()  # No argument == latest released version
```

## Running

The {doc}`site/tutorial` demonstrates how to set up, run, and visualize the
outputs of the cell-type inference pipeline.

This tutorial can also be run locally with `jupyter`.

Start by cloning the sorce repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-types.git && cd deepcell-types
```

Ensure that all necessary extra dependencies are installed in your virtual
environment (along with `deepcell-types` itself):

```bash
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt .
```

Launch a jupyter lab instance:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Then open the tutorial at `docs/site/tutorial.md`.

```{note}
Depending on your `jupyterlab` version, you may need to right-click the tutorial.md
and select `Open with -> Jupytext notebook`.
```

## Limitations

1. **Maximum channel limit**

   The latest canonical checkpoints support a maximum of **80** channels per
   dataset. Legacy checkpoints, including the current registered public release,
   support **75** channels. If your dataset has more channels than the selected
   checkpoint supports, it will be necessary to remove channels to get below
   that limit. Note that (by default) nuclear and non-recognized channel names
   are automatically dropped.

2. **Recognized channels**

   Canonical checkpoints read their registry of natively-supported channels and
   cell types from the TissueNet zarr archive provided at inference time via
   `zarr_path=...` or `DEEPCELL_TYPES_ZARR_PATH`. In practice this means the
   recognized canonical channels are whatever the selected archive exposes in
   its root `attrs.all_standardized_channels`. Legacy checkpoints continue to
   use
   [`deepcell_types/dct_kit/config/master_channels.yaml`][master_channels_gh].
   If your data contains markers not found in this listing, they will be
   ignored at inference time.
   There are two ways to add support for additional channels:

   - To add a new alias for a marker name that is currently supported, add the
     alias to `deepcell_types/dct_kit/config/channel_mapping.yaml`. For example,
     if your data contains a channel named `FP3` representing the `FoxP3` marker,
     add the following line to `channel_mapping.yaml`:

         FP3: FoxP3

     Note that the target name (`FoxP3` in this example) must be one of the
     names already found in the selected checkpoint's channel registry.

   - Adding new markers to the model can be achieved by manually acquiring
     embeddings for additional channels via DeepSeek (model and prompt details
     can be found in the paper).

   Canonical checkpoint loading also validates that the archive and checkpoint
   agree on marker count and cell-type count. If they do not, inference fails
   early with a `ValueError`.

3. **Image preprocessing**

   The model requires users to preprocess input images to align with the
   distribution of our training data for optimal performance and generalization.
   See the paper for details.
