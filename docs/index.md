deepcell-types documentation
============================

DeepCell Types is a novel approach to cell phenotyping for spatial proteomics
that addresses the challenge of generalization across diverse datasets with
varying marker panels.

For details on running the cell-type inference workflow, see the {doc}`site/tutorial`.

The source code can be found at the [github repo][github].

For access to pre-trained models and datasets, see {doc}`site/API-key`.

## Installation

The development version of `deepcell-types` can be installed with `pip`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-types@master
```

## Pre-trained models

A pre-trained model is required to run the cell-type inference pipeline.
Pre-trained models are available via the [users.deepcell.org][dc_org] portal
according to the [license terms][license].
See {doc}`site/API-key` for details.

The latest version can be downloaded like so:

```python
from deepcell_types.utils import download_model

download_model()  # No argument == latest released version
```

## Running

The {doc}`site/tutorial` demonstrates how to set up, run, and visualize the
outputs of the cell-type inference pipeline.

This tutorial can also be run locally with `jupyter`.

Start by cloning the source repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-types.git && cd deepcell-types
```

Ensure that all necessary extra dependencies are installed in your virtual
environment (along with `deepcell-types` itself):

```bash
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt .
```

Launch a jupyter lab instance:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Then open the tutorial at `docs/site/tutorial.md`.

```{note}
Depending on your `jupyterlab` version, you may need to right-click the tutorial.md
and select `Open with -> Jupytext notebook`.
```

## Limitations

1. **Maximum channel limit**

   The model supports a maximum of **80** channels per dataset. If your data has
   more channels than this limit, it will be necessary to remove channels to get
   below it. Note that (by default) nuclear and non-recognized channel names are
   automatically dropped.

2. **Recognized channels**

   By default the model reads its registry of natively-supported channels and
   cell types from the `vocab.json` snapshot shipped with the package, so
   inference needs no archive download. The recognized channels are the markers
   listed in that snapshot. You can override it by pointing inference at a
   TissueNet zarr archive (pass `zarr_path=...` or set the
   `DEEPCELL_TYPES_ZARR_PATH` environment variable), in which case the
   recognized channels are whatever the selected archive exposes in its root
   `attrs.all_standardized_channels`. Either way, markers not found in the
   active registry are ignored at inference time.

   To inspect the canonical marker registry before downloading a checkpoint,
   call `list_supported_markers()` (and `list_supported_cell_types()` for the
   recognized cell-type labels). To check a panel name using the same alias
   and capitalization handling as inference, call
   `resolve_supported_marker()`:

   ```python
   import deepcell_types

   deepcell_types.list_supported_markers()
   deepcell_types.resolve_supported_marker("Pan-Cytokeratin")  # "PanCK"
   ```

   There are two ways to add support for additional channels:

   - To add a new alias for a marker name that is currently supported, add the
     alias to `deepcell_types/channel_mapping.yaml`. For example,
     if your data contains a channel named `FP3` representing the `FoxP3` marker,
     add the following line to `channel_mapping.yaml`:

         FP3: FoxP3

     Note that the target name (`FoxP3` in this example) must be one of the
     names already found in the selected checkpoint's channel registry.

   - Adding new markers to the model can be achieved by manually acquiring
     embeddings for additional channels via OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large`
     model. The reference helper that generates these embeddings from a
     channel's plain-English name is `scripts/generate_openai_embeddings.py`
     (model and prompt details can be found in the paper).

   Checkpoint loading validates that the archive and checkpoint agree on marker
   count and cell-type count. If they do not, inference fails early with a
   `ValueError`.

3. **Image preprocessing**

   The model requires users to preprocess input images to align with the
   distribution of our training data for optimal performance and generalization.
   See the paper for details.

## Training

The repository also ships the training pipeline used to produce the canonical
checkpoints. Training-only code lives under `deepcell_types.training` and is
gated behind the `[train]` install extra so plain inference users don't pull
in `zarr`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, etc.

```bash
pip install "deepcell-types[train] @ git+https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-types@master"
```

The end-to-end training and evaluation scripts live under `scripts/`:

- `scripts/train.py` — main training entry point.
- `scripts/predict.py` — batched predictions over a zarr archive, with
  optional hierarchy-aware evaluation.
- `scripts/pretrain.py` — masked-marker pretraining stage.

All training scripts read mappings and metadata from a TissueNet zarr v3
archive (`expanded-tissuenet.zarr`). Pass the archive path with
`--zarr_dir` (training scripts) or via the `DEEPCELL_TYPES_ZARR_PATH`
environment variable (`deepcell_types.predict`).
