Model and Datasets
==================

DeepCell models and training datasets are licensed under a 
[modified Apache license][license] for non-commercial academic use only.
An API key for accessing datasets and models can be obtained at <https://users.deepcell.org/login/>.

API Key Usage
-------------

The token that is issued by <https://users.deepcell.org> should be added as an
environment variable:

```bash
export DEEPCELL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token-from-users.deepcell.org>
```

This line can be added to your shell configuration (e.g. ``.bashrc``, ``.zshrc``,
``.bash_profile``, etc.) to automatically grant access to DeepCell models/data
upon login.

Models
------

The model can be downloaded for local use:

```python
>>> from deepcell_types.utils import download_model

>>> download_model()
```

A specific version can be requested:

```python
download_model(version="2026-06-15")
```

A listing of available pre-trained model versions is available from
`deepcell_types.utils.list_model_versions()`.

To fetch a baseline checkpoint instead of the main DeepCellTypes model:

```python
from deepcell_types.utils import download_baseline_checkpoint

# One of: "cellsighter", "maps", "nimbus", "xgboost"
download_baseline_checkpoint("maps")
```

Training Data
-------------

```{warning}
The training dataset is over 1.3 TB - make sure you have space and sufficient
network bandwidth before attempting to download.
```

Similarly, training data can be downloaded for local use with:

```python
>>> from deepcell_types.utils import download_training_data
>>> download_training_data()
```
