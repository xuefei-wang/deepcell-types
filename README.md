# DeepCell Types

DeepCell Types is a generalized cell-phenotyping model for spatial
proteomics. It addresses generalization across datasets with varying
marker panels by reading the active marker / cell-type registry from a
TissueNet zarr archive at inference time.

## Installation

As with all Python packages, users are encouraged to use some form
of virtual environment for package installation.
Popular options include `venv`/`virtualenv`, `conda`/`mamba`, `uv`,
or `pixi`.
Users are encouraged to use whatever environment management toolchain
they are most comfortable with.
For those unsure, the quickest way to start is to use the `venv` module,
part of the Python standard library:

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment
python -m venv dct-env
# Enter the virtual environment
source dct-env/bin/activate

# Once inside the environment, install deepcell-types
pip install git+https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-types@master
```

## Download the model
```python
from deepcell_types.utils import download_model
download_model()
```

## TissueNet zarr archive

Canonical checkpoints do not embed the marker / cell-type registry —
they read it from a **TissueNet zarr v3 archive** at inference time. You
must provide one before calling `predict`, either by passing
`zarr_path=...` directly or by setting the `DEEPCELL_TYPES_ZARR_PATH`
environment variable.

A registered user can download a public TissueNet zarr archive from
`https://users.deepcell.org`; see `docs/site/API-key.md` for the access
token flow. Place the resulting `.zarr` directory anywhere, then:

```bash
export DEEPCELL_TYPES_ZARR_PATH=/absolute/path/to/tissuenet.zarr
```

### Validating an archive before publishing

The archive's `all_standardized_channels` attribute *is* the model's
marker→index map, so it must match the order the released checkpoint and
`embeddings/svd_512.npz` were built with — reordering or resizing it silently
breaks inference. Before publishing an archive (or a checkpoint), run the
release gate against the real archive and the released embeddings:

```bash
scripts/check_release_archive.sh /path/to/tissuenet.zarr /path/to/svd_512.npz
```

It exits non-zero on any marker-order/size drift. (The check's logic is
unit-tested in CI via `tests/test_archive_contract_validator.py`; this script
runs it against the actual archive, which CI cannot access.)

## Running

The `deepcell-types` cell-type inference functionality is provided via
a simple functional interface, `deepcell_types.predict`.

For a complete example of the cell-type inference pipeline, check out
the [tutorial](https://vanvalenlab.github.io/deepcell-types/site/tutorial.html).

### Custom preprocessing (advanced)

When a single FOV's predictions look biologically implausible — usually because
one channel is saturated or has heavy background and is steering the calls — the
fix is to adapt the per-channel normalization for that FOV.

**Start with the `preproc-adapt` skill** (`skills/preproc-adapt/`). It is the
recommended, first-and-foremost way to do this: an agent-driven loop that
inspects the panel, predicts, checks the cell-type composition against tissue
biology, diagnoses *which* channel/op is the problem, and iterates the config for
you — so you don't have to guess the ops by hand. Use it before hand-tuning.

Under the hood the skill drives `predict`'s optional `preprocess` hook, which you
can also call directly if you already know the fix. Build one declaratively from a
bounded set of ops:

```python
from deepcell_types import predict, make_preprocessor

config = [
    {"op": "clip_percentile", "p": 99.9},
    {"op": "channel_drop", "names": ["NeuN"]},  # drop a confounding marker
    {"op": "min_max_normalize"},                # model sees [0, 1]
]
labels = predict(raw, mask, channel_names, mpp, model_name=...,
                 device="cuda:0", preprocess=make_preprocessor(config))
```

The hook receives the resampled, in-vocabulary raw `(C, H, W)` array and the
resolved marker names, and must return a `(C, H, W)` array in `[0, 1]`. With
`preprocess=None` (default) the built-in p99.9 clip + min-max is used;
`make_preprocessor(DEFAULT_CONFIG)` reproduces that default exactly.

## Training

To retrain or fine-tune, install the `[train]` extra (pulls in `zarr`,
`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `torchmetrics`, plotly, etc.):

```bash
pip install "deepcell-types[train] @ git+https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-types@master"
```

Training entry points live under `scripts/`:

- `scripts/train.py` — main training loop (stage 1: backbone, weighted sampler on).
- `scripts/retrain_head.py` — stage 2: freeze the backbone, retrain the residual-MLP
  cell-type head on the natural class distribution (sampler off). This decoupled
  recipe is the recommended paper workflow and produces the best model
  (`ct_head_arch="resmlp"`).
- `scripts/pretrain.py` — masked-marker pretraining.
- `scripts/predict.py` — batched evaluation over a zarr archive.
- `scripts/evaluate_on_test.sh` — **canonical evaluation on the held-out 129-FOV
  test split** (`splits/fov_split_test_current.json`). All headline cell-type numbers
  are reported on this frozen, leakage-free test set; this is the default eval.

All training scripts read configuration from a TissueNet zarr v3 archive.
Pass `--zarr_dir` (training scripts) or set `DEEPCELL_TYPES_ZARR_PATH`
(picked up by `deepcell_types.predict`). The training-side
modules under `deepcell_types.training` (e.g. `TissueNetConfig`,
`FullImageDataset`, `FocalLoss`, `HierarchicalLoss`) are stable enough to
import directly for custom training scripts.

## Baselines

All four paper comparison baselines are folded into `deepcell_types.baselines`
and run via the unified runner `python -m deepcell_types.baselines <name>`.
No submodules are required.

- **XGBoost** — XGBoost on mean-marker-intensity features.

  ```bash
  pip install -e ".[baseline-xgboost]"
  python -m deepcell_types.baselines xgboost ...
  python -m deepcell_types.baselines xgboost-tune ...
  ```

- **Nimbus** — Nimbus UNet marker-positivity baseline
  ([Rumberger et al., *Nature Methods* 2025](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-025-02826-9)).

  ```bash
  pip install -e ".[baseline-nimbus]"
  python -m deepcell_types.baselines nimbus ...
  ```

  > **Note:** `baseline-nimbus` pins `nimbus-inference==0.0.5`, which
  > requires Python <3.12. Use a Python 3.11 environment for this baseline.

  python -m deepcell_types.baselines maps ...
