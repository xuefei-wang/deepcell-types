# DeepCell Types

DeepCell Types is a novel approach to cell phenotyping for spatial proteomics that addresses the challenge of generalization across diverse datasets with varying marker panels. 


## Download the model
```python
from deepcell_types.utils import download_model
download_model()
```

## Installation

As with all Python packages, users are encouraged to use some form
of virtual environment for package installation.
Popular options include `venv`/`virtualenv`, `conda`/`mamba`, `uv`,
or `pixi`.
Users are encouraged to use whatever environment management toolchain
they are most comfortable with.
For those unsure, the quickest way to start is to use the `venv` module,
part of the Python standard library:

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment
python -m venv dct-env
# Enter the virtual environment
source dct-env/bin/activate

# Once inside the environment, install deepcell-types
pip install git+https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-types@master
```

## Running

The `deepcell-types` cell-type inference functionality is provided via
a simple functional interface, `deepcell_types.predict`.

Canonical checkpoints read their marker and cell-type registry from a
TissueNet zarr archive at inference time. Pass the archive with
`zarr_path=...` or set `DEEPCELL_TYPES_ZARR_PATH` before calling
`deepcell_types.predict`.

For a complete example of the cell-type inference pipeline, check out
