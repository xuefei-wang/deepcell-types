"""Tests for the post-hoc CT abstention wired into scripts/predict.py.

Exercises the lower-level building blocks in `deepcell_types.training.abstention` —
`compute_iqr_fence` and `apply_abstention` — that the CLI wires up. Five
scenarios are covered, mirroring the deliverables checklist:

1. Default (no abstention applied) — `apply_abstention` not called → no
   `abstained` column, no `-1` sentinels.
2. k=1.5 on a synthetic 100-cell frame → ~0.23% abstained (near-no-op).
3. k=0.5 on the same frame → ~10% abstained (aggressive).
4. Per-(tissue, modality) grouping is honoured (different fences per group).
5. Degenerate distribution (all max-softmax identical) yields no abstentions.
